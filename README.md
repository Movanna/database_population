Python scripts for populating a database for a digital edition

The database belongs to an edition project which publishes the works of the Finnish author and politician Leo Mechelin (1839â€“1914). The edition will be published on a website, as e-books and in print. The PostgreSQL database is part of a generic digital edition platform, managed by the Society of Swedish Literature in Finland (see https://github.com/slsfi/digital_edition_documentation/wiki).

The database contains information about editions, texts, manuscripts, facsimiles, editorial texts and persons related to the texts. Contrary to the earlier projects using the same digital edition platform (and thus database), this project is bilingual (Swedish/Finnish), so some changes were made to the original database schema in order to accommodate translations.
